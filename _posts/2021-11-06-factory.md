### The aim of a creational design pattern is to provide better alternatives for situations where a direct object creation (which in Python happens by the __init__() function [j.mp/divefunc], [Lott14, page 26]) is not convenient. 
### In the Factory design pattern, a client asks for an object without knowing where the object is coming from(that is, which class is used to generate it).
